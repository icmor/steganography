#+title: Basic image steganography

A small program to merge images together. It's not the prettiest and it should definitely use less bit masks, but it's pretty nifty nonetheless.

To handle different aspect ratios, it encodes the dimensions of the hidden image in its first couple pixels. It writes this information in the lower 4 bits of each color value (also nibble) and the first nibble holds how many bytes are needed to hold each dimension. 3 pixels = 9 bytes (12 if CMYK) - 1 byte = 8 nibbles = 8 * 4 bits = 32 bits = 32 / 2 = 16 bits so with 3 pixels, dimensions of the hidden image can be up to 2**16 x 2**16.

I'm going to add hiding text in images and probably a couple different methods of merging two images together. LSB is cool but there are some cases where the other image is very apparent (especially when merging a very high contrast image into a low contrast one).
